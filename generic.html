									<h1>Living Curiously,<br />
									Learning Constantly</h1>
									<p>“You will see things and meet people and there is so much to learn from them.” <br>
										― Christopher Johnson McCandless, Into the Wild</p>

									My adult life could be characterized as a pursuit in squeezing the most out of each day.
									Since I was a child meandering around the Texas Panhandle I have believed that new experience is the zest of life.
									In this spirit I have attained a bachelors with honors
									in Biochemistry, taught myself various aspects of data specific programming, become a driven surfer, jeweler,
									and surfboard shaper all before the age of twenty-three. Following the completion of my undergraduate degree, I 
									relocated to Oregon's Willamette Valley where I manage a small, but bustling local coffee shop.
									Amidst this I have carved out invaluable time building data-driven analytical skills as well as becoming a Pacific coastline 
									regular immersing myself in the daily cinematic beauty of the region. 
									<br> <br>
									I hope to lean further into adulthood with a career that allows me to use my knowledge to aid others.
									Whether artistic or academic, I have an insatiable appetite for the opportunity to learn and improve upon the things
									I hold dearest to my heart. Despite a wealth of experiences under my belt, it feels as though I am standing at an exposition,
									eagerly awaiting what comes next.
